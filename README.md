# Kinetics
Calculates time evolutions of chemical equilibria

The user can follow the instructions given in the console to input the data required.
The program will output to datafiles to store the concentration data, either at equilibrium or over time.

The inputs for the first task are hard-coded, but for the second task any system can be used as input.

To see the plots, either use PlotPart1.py, to see the graph produced for task 1 (protein folding), or
PlotPart2.py, to see the graph for the second task. The captions used assume that the system being used
is the system from the course guide, but these could be in priciple changed quite easily - this could be made into
a runtime thing, with the user specifying the legend.
